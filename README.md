L.I.S.A is a Lightweight Intelligent System Assistant that I am desiging. 
The current version combines python and the llama llm to provide some interesting functionality.
I've added a first draft front end and the basic idea will be to provide the functions that Alexa/Siri do 
and when we are asked a question we don't know we query llama and respond from there. The model will currently be running 
on my device for testing purposes.
